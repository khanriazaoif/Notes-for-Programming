# Markdown Basics

## Headlines, Paragraphs, and Basic Formatting

### Headlines

Type a single hash (AKA pound symbol) and a space to create the largest or first-level heading. A second-level heading uses two hashes next to each other followed by a space and text. The rest of the headline levels just add another hash.

#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

We create paragraphs by typing the way we would in any other program. Just hit return twice to start another paragraph.

Where you see empty space between blocks of text in your Markdown document, you will see empty space separating those blocks of text in your formatted HTML document.

#### Line Breaks

You don’t always want that space that appears between one line of text and another: for example, lines of poetry or song lyrics don't have spaces between them. To add just a line break without a space, type two spaces at the end of a line, then press return once.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or  
from where  
I love you directly without problems or pride:  
I love you like this because I don't know any  
other way to love

### Emphasis and Bolding

#### Italics

Emphasis can be added with either the asterisk or the underscore characters.

This *works*, and this _works_ too

#### Bolding

Bolding is easy too. Just add an extra asterisk or underscore.

This **works**, and this __works__ too

#### Bolding and Emphasis Together

You can even bold and italicize text like ***this*** or ___this___

### Blockquotes

A blockquote sets text apart from the rest of the document. It indicates that the text is quoted from another source.

You format a blockquote using the greater than symbol. If you want a blockquote to span multiple paragraphs, add the greater than symbol to the line between paragraphs too.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. — John Gruber

### Horizontal Rule

OK, that’s a good start. We can separate this from our next section with a horizontal rule, which is just a line used to separate sections of a document.

You can use three or more underscores, asterisks, or hyphens. I prefer hyphens.
